            <h1>Part 1: Root Cause Analysis - Why Hiring Systems Are Failing Mid-Level Performance and Retention</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Despite investments in modern recruitment tools and processes, many organizations have not seen improvements in key outcomes – namely employee performance, job satisfaction, turnover, and success rates – for professional staff and mid-level managers. Industry benchmarks show that employee engagement and retention remain stubbornly low, indicating systemic issues in how we hire and onboard talent.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">31%</div>
                <p>Only about 31% of U.S. employees are engaged at work as of 2024, while 17% are actively disengaged</p>
            </div>

            <p>Turnover rates similarly hover in the double digits (the average U.S. voluntary turnover is ~13–17% per year) – an expensive drain on organizational performance. Below, we identify the top five systemic problems undermining hiring outcomes, with evidence-based links to performance shortfalls, low engagement (Gallup Q12 metrics), high turnover, and lack of new-hire success.</p>

            <h2>1. Lack of Role Clarity and Ineffective Onboarding</h2>
            
            <p>One fundamental breakdown is the failure to define roles clearly and support new hires through effective onboarding. New employees often discover that the job reality differs from what they were sold, leading to frustration and early exits.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>In a survey of 1,500 workers, <strong>43%</strong> of those who quit within 90 days said their day-to-day role "wasn't what they had been led to believe" during hiring. One-third of new hires quit in the first three months, signaling a massive failure of the hiring and onboarding process.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Poor onboarding exacerbates this issue. Gallup finds only 12% of employees strongly agree their organization does a great job of onboarding newcomers. The vast majority of companies leave new hires feeling adrift. A weak start erodes engagement – research shows inconsistent or "poor" onboarding leads to disillusionment, alienation, and low morale.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Gallup Q12 Connection:</strong> The very first Gallup Q12 engagement item is "I know what is expected of me at work," underscoring how critical role clarity is from day one. When this is missing at onboarding, employees are left guessing – undermining engagement and productivity.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Evidence of Impact:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizations with strong onboarding programs see <strong>52% higher retention</strong> of new hires and a <strong>60% boost in productivity</strong></li>
                <li>New employees who feel supported are <strong>2.6× more likely</strong> to be satisfied in their jobs long-term</li>
                <li>Texas Instruments overhauled its onboarding process and found that new hires reached full productivity <strong>two months faster</strong> than those hired under the old process</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Inadequate Hiring Manager Capability and Training</h2>

            <p>Another systemic problem is the skill (or lack thereof) of hiring managers. The very people making hiring decisions – often line managers or mid-level leaders – frequently lack training in effective interviewing and selection techniques.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">&lt;5%</div>
                <p>Less than 5% of hiring managers have received professional interview training in the past four years</p>
            </div>

            <p>Many managers approach hiring as an ad-hoc responsibility rather than a core competency. As a result, unconscious biases and "gut feel" drive decisions instead of evidence. Unstructured interviews have a meager ~14% predictive validity for future performance – barely better than chance – yet they remain the default when managers are left to their own devices.</p>

            <h3>The Impact:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>46% of new hires fail within 18 months</strong></li>
                <li><strong>89% of those failures</strong> are due to attitude/cultural issues – not lack of technical skills</li>
                <li>This points directly at hiring managers selecting for the wrong traits or failing to screen for fit</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Gallup Q12 Connection:</strong> Gallup research famously attributes 70% of the variance in a team's engagement to the manager. A capable, well-trained manager is crucial not just after hiring, but during hiring.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>3. Poor Talent Pipeline and Inadequate Candidate Quality</h2>

            <p>Even the best hiring managers cannot hire superior performers if the talent pipeline feeding the organization is weak. A systemic problem in many companies is a shallow or mismanaged talent pipeline that yields too few qualified candidates – or an abundance of applicants who don't meet basic requirements.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>In a 2024 recruiting survey, <strong>63.3% of employers</strong> reported receiving too many unqualified applicants via job boards and online platforms. This was the most commonly cited recruiting challenge.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Root Causes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of strategic sourcing</strong> and employer branding</li>
                <li><strong>Passive posting</strong> to generic job boards attracts high volume of ill-suited applicants</li>
                <li><strong>Lengthy application processes</strong> – the best candidates are often off the market within 10 days, but average time-to-hire is 38 days</li>
                <li><strong>Failure to develop internal talent</strong> – forcing every mid-level opening to be filled externally under time pressure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Flawed Talent Strategy – Filtering Out Rather Than Attracting Top Talent</h2>

            <p>Many hiring systems are designed with a defensive mindset – filtering out candidates who don't tick every box – rather than actively courting the best talent. This "weeding out" approach often stems from rigid job requirements, cumbersome screening processes, and an overreliance on automated filters or arbitrary criteria.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="number">94%</div>
                <p>of employers acknowledge their ATS filters out qualified candidates</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Examples of Flawed Filtering:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overly rigid selection criteria</strong> – insisting on specific schools, exact industry experience, or perfectly linear career history</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword-based resume screening</strong> that tosses out resumes without exact matches</li>
                <li><strong>Automated filters</strong> that reject resumes with employment gaps regardless of reason</li>
                <li><strong>Lengthy, impersonal hiring processes</strong> that drive away top candidates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Inadequate HR Leadership in Process, Analytics, and Strategic Decision-Making</h2>

            <p>The final critical root cause is a lack of strong HR leadership and analytics-driven strategy overseeing the hiring process. In many organizations, HR has not taken a proactive, data-driven role in optimizing hiring.</p>

            <h3>Key Issues:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial metrics misaligned</strong> – focus on "cost per hire" or "time to fill" rather than quality of hire and retention</li>
                <li><strong>Only 26% of organizations</strong> have a formal way to measure quality of hire</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics skill gap</strong> – people analytics is the single largest skills deficit among HR professionals</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient training and resources</strong> allocated to recruitment</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>The Cost of Bad Hires:</strong> A bad mid-level hire can cost the organization over $120,000 when you factor in lost productivity, team disruption, hiring and training costs for a replacement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Across these five systemic issues – unclear roles/onboarding, weak hiring manager skills, poor talent pipelines, flawed filtering strategies, and absent HR leadership – a common theme emerges: <strong>hiring is not being treated as the strategic, data-informed process it needs to be for professional and managerial talent.</strong></p>

            <p>Reversing these trends requires addressing each root cause with intentional action:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarify and communicate role expectations from recruitment through onboarding</li>
                <li>Train and equip hiring managers to make better decisions</li>
                <li>Build robust pipelines and emphasize quality over quantity of candidates</li>
                <li>Shift talent strategy to focus on wooing the right people, not just filtering out others</li>
                <li>Have HR lead with analytics and process excellence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hiring processes for professional and managerial roles often suffer from chronic, systemic issues. Below we evaluate how a Performance-Based Hiring (PBH) approach could address five pervasive problems in hiring, and then examine why HR has largely failed to lead fixes for these issues despite clear evidence of ineffective practices.</p>

            <h2>Performance-Based Hiring as a Solution to Key Hiring Problems</h2>

            <p>Performance-Based Hiring is an approach (pioneered by Lou Adler and others) that centers recruitment on defining and assessing a candidate's ability to deliver specific job outcomes, rather than on proxy qualifications like years of experience or generic competencies. By crafting roles around measurable performance objectives ("success outcomes") and using structured interviews to evaluate past accomplishments, PBH aims to improve the quality of hires and their subsequent success in the role.</p>

            <h2>1. Clarifying Roles and Improving Onboarding</h2>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>Many companies lack clarity in job definitions, leading to mismatched expectations and poor onboarding of new hires. Research shows that lack of role clarity undermines performance and retention – employees with clear role expectations are 27% more effective and far more likely to stay committed.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>How PBH Helps:</h3>
                <p>Performance-Based Hiring forces upfront clarity by defining <strong>Key Performance Objectives (KPOs)</strong> for the role. Instead of a laundry list of qualifications, the hiring team articulates what the new hire needs to accomplish – for example, "Build a 3-year sales strategy and grow revenue 15% in year one" rather than "MBA required."</p>
                
                <p>This creates a crystal-clear picture of the role's expectations for both candidates and hiring managers. Candidates are assessed on their ability to deliver these outcomes, aligning everyone on "what success looks like" from day one.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Elevating Hiring Manager Capability</h2>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>Hiring managers are often undertrained and unprepared to interview and select talent effectively. Many organizations "hand off" the recruiting process to managers who may interview infrequently and rely on gut instinct.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>How PBH Helps:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demands a more disciplined, trained hiring manager through collaboration on defining performance outcomes</li>
                    <li>Introduces <strong>structured interviewing</strong> anchored on outcomes rather than random questions</li>
                    <li>Shifts managers from unstructured chats to evidence-based evaluations</li>
                    <li>Includes training on interviewing and assessment techniques</li>
                    <li>Focuses on how skills were applied to deliver results, reducing subjective "gut hires"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>3. Building a Stronger Talent Pipeline & Candidate Quality</h2>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>Traditional hiring yields a poor talent pipeline – either a dearth of qualified candidates or a flood of applicants with low signal-to-noise. Over-reliance on job postings and passive filtering leads to recruiters getting hundreds of resumes that meet keyword filters but not the true needs.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>How PBH Helps:</h3>
                <p>Performance-Based Hiring can improve pipeline quality by fundamentally changing how roles are pitched and how candidates are evaluated. Job postings in a PBH model are centered on <strong>compelling challenges and outcomes</strong> of the role, not a dull checklist of qualifications.</p>
                
                <p>This attracts candidates who are genuinely motivated by the work and who self-select based on ability. It tends to draw in proven achievers (including passive candidates) excited by a clear opportunity to deliver results.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Moving Beyond a Filter-Focused Talent Strategy</h2>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>Many hiring systems are built around elimination by filters – narrow criteria in ATS software, rigid checkboxes, and automated screening tools. A Harvard Business School report found that 94% of employers acknowledge their ATS filters out qualified candidates.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>How PBH Helps:</h3>
                <p>Performance-Based Hiring flips the script from "Who can we screen out?" to "Who has the ability to deliver results in this role?" Rather than using proxy filters as a first pass, PBH emphasizes a <strong>holistic evaluation of job-related competencies and achievements</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>Under PBH, a candidate who lacks a conventional qualification but has proven they can hit the outcomes would be advanced – the exact opposite of an ATS autopsy that might have eliminated them.</p>

            <h2>5. Strengthening HR's Analytical, Strategic, and Process Leadership</h2>

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>The hiring dysfunctions are often symptoms of weak HR leadership in talent strategy and process design. HR teams may be stuck in a transactional or compliance-oriented mode rather than leading talent strategy innovation.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>How PBH Helps:</h3>
                <p>If adopted, Performance-Based Hiring could be a vehicle for HR to demonstrate strategic leadership – it inherently requires using <strong>analytics, strategy, and process discipline</strong>. Implementing PBH means HR must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborate with business leaders to define success metrics for new hires</li>
                    <li>Track whether those metrics are met (quality of hire)</li>
                    <li>Embrace data on employee performance, retention, and hiring outcomes</li>
                    <li>Exercise strong project management and change leadership</li>
                    <li>Move from being "req processors" to talent advisors who use data and business logic</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Why HR Has Not Led the Charge in Fixing These Hiring Issues</h2>

            <p>Given the mounting evidence that many traditional hiring practices are ineffective, one might expect HR departments to be aggressively driving reforms like Performance-Based Hiring. Yet by and large, pervasive problems persist and PBH (or similar approaches) are not mainstream. Several organizational, structural, and leadership factors help explain HR's inaction:</p>

            <h3>Key Barriers:</h3>

            <h4>1. HR's Organizational Positioning and Authority</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HR often lacks a strong voice in strategic decisions</li>
                <li>Viewed as administrative/compliance function rather than business driver</li>
                <li>Cannot unilaterally overhaul processes without buy-in</li>
                <li>Weak "seat at the table" leads to reactive rather than transformative approach</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Incentives and KPIs Misaligned with Quality</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HR measured on wrong metrics: time-to-fill, positions closed, cost-per-hire</li>
                <li>No direct capture of quality of hire or long-term success</li>
                <li>PBH might initially slow process, making HR's numbers look worse</li>
                <li>Only about 25% of organizations formally track quality-of-hire data</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Lack of Analytics and Data Skills in HR</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>People analytics is the single largest skills gap for HR professionals</li>
                <li>80% of HR pros say AI and metrics are central to HR's future, yet most lack strength in this area</li>
                <li>Without analytics, HR can't build compelling case for change</li>
                <li>May not fully realize current situation severity without data insights</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Dependence on External Vendors and "Quick Fix" Tools</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tendency to outsource to recruitment agencies rather than build internal capability</li>
                <li>Over-reliance on HR tech that automates the wrong things</li>
                <li>Vendor solutions offer plausible deniability when hires fail</li>
                <li>Reduces HR's influence and strategic ownership</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Cultural and Leadership Barriers to Change</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Without C-suite championship, HR alone struggles to mandate change</li>
                <li>Some organizations have complacency about hiring</li>
                <li>HR leaders may be risk-averse or lack fresh perspectives</li>
                <li>Internal politics can hinder HR from encroaching on manager autonomy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Performance-Based Hiring appears to be a highly effective antidote to the five systemic hiring problems. By emphasizing role-specific outcomes, it resolves role ambiguity and sets new hires up for success from the start. The academic research and case examples show clear improvements in quality of hire, retention, engagement, and productivity when organizations adopt performance-based hiring practices.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Performance-Based Hiring can be a powerful solution to the systemic problems – but HR's leadership is the linchpin. If HR can overcome internal barriers and lead with a compelling, evidence-backed vision, the five chronic hiring issues can be markedly reduced.</p>

            <p>For Performance-Based Hiring (or any strategic hiring upgrade) to take root, companies will likely need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elevate HR's position</strong> and re-align priorities</li>
                <li><strong>Give HR the mandate</strong> to optimize quality over speed</li>
                <li><strong>Invest in HR's data skills</strong> and analytics capabilities</li>

            </ul>
